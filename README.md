# Rubik's Cube Solver for a×a×a Cubes

This project implements a solver for Rubik's Cubes of any size `N×NxN`. The solver uses algorithmic techniques to find efficient solutions for the cube based on its current scrambled state.

## Features
- Supports **any size** cube, from 2×2×2 (Pocket Cube) to larger NxNxN cubes.
- Efficient solution generation using **CFOP**.
- Interactive input of the cube’s scrambled state.
- Visual representation of the solving steps.
